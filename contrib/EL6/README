# contrib/EL6/README
This is sample configuration files to drive an Apache 2.2 instance for 
SquidGuard Manager on RHEL/CentOS 6.x.  Many files were borrowed  from 
CentOS 6 distribution.

# Structure

/etc/httpd/
    \_ conf/               -- This is ServerRoot of the httpd daemon.
        squidguardmgr.conf -- Apache configuration file.
        .htpasswd          -- Optional but recommended. See note.
    \_ conf.d/
        squidguardmgr.cf   -- Directory and Alias settings for SquidGuard 
                              Manager WWWDIR
        perl.conf          -- May be provided by distribution's mod_perl pkg.
/etc/sysconfig/
    squidguardmgr          -- httpd runtime options read by init-file below.
/etc/init.d/
    squidguardmgr          -- Init file for httpd driving SquidGuard Manager. 
                              Rename rc_squidguardmgr file and set permission
                              root:root 755.
/var/www/
    \_ squid-gui/          -- This is httpd's DocumentRoot. Can be empty.
    \_ sgmgr/              -- WWWDIR = CGIDIR of SquidGuard Manager, automatically
                              made through installation of SquidGuard Manager if
                              you give proper arguments to Makefile.PL.
/var/log/httpd/
    \_ squidguardmgr/      -- httpd's log directory.
/etc/logrotate.d/
    squidguardmgr          -- logrotate configuration file.

Note:
You don't need to permit read nor write access to these files for squid account.
If you want (may be you do want) to limit access to  SquidGuard Manager Web GUI,
generate .htpasswd file using htpasswd command, then look into the commented-out 
lines in squidguardmgr.cf.
Enjoy ;-)
