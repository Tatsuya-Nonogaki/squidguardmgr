<p>
Rewrite rule groups, or rewrite rule sets if you prefer, are declared like sed style substitution.
</p>
<p>In the 'Replace' input box you give a regular expression that will be replaced with the string you've set into the 'with' input box. For example:
</p>
<pre>
	Replace : .*\.olddomain\.com with : www\.newdomain\.com
</pre>
<p>
- Select the 'Case insensitive' checkbox if the pattern search must be case insensitive.<br>
- Select the 'Show move temporary' checkbox if you want to make the redirection visible to the user with a HTTP code 302 - Moved Temporarily.<br>
- Select the 'Show move permanently' checkbox if you want to makes the redirection visible to the user with a HTTP code 301 - Moved Permanently.
</p>
<p>
The default is to make Squid silently fetch the alternate URL.
</p>
<p>
Time constraints on rewrite groups can be used to make these groups functional within or outside a given time space only;
