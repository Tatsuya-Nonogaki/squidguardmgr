<p>
Time spaces, schedules or zones if you prefer, are declared by days of the week
or dates with an optional time constraint for the date or day selection.
</p>
<p>
Each schedule definition can be used as a constraint in other object like sources, URL rewriting, and filters.
</p>
<p>
Overlaps are OK, and the result is the union.
</p>
<p>
If you use date, you can set a space separated list of dates and/or date range
with fixed year, month, day, or use wildcard instead.

<pre>
For instance, for the chrismas and new year days

The week between these days:

	2010.12.25-2011.01.01

These days for all coming years:

	*.12.25 *.01.01
