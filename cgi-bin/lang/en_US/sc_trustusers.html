The trusted user definition allows you to disable chained program and virus scan when an user ident matches the search pattern. On regex found SquidClamav fallbacks to Squid instantly. Of course you must have Squid authentication helper enabled.

For example:
</p>
<pre>
	administrator
</pre>
<p>
will let user logged as administrator not be bored by chained program and virus scan.
