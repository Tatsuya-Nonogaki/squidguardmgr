The trusted client definition allows you to disable chained program and virus scan when a client source IP address or hostname match the search pattern. On regex found, SquidClamav falls back to Squid instantly. Of course you must have Squid authentication helper enabled.

For example:
</p>
<pre>
	192\.168\.1\.10
	myhomepc
	10\.18\.10\..*
</pre>
<p>
will let clients with IP 192.168.1.10, with hostname myhomepc and any host under the 10.18.10.0/24 subnet not be bored by chained program and virus scan.
