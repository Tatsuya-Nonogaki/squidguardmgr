<p>
Filter, destination or target groups if you prefer, are declared by: 
</p>
<pre>
	- an optional time constraint to the definition.
	- any combination of zero or one of each of: domains list, urls list and expressions list
</pre>

<p>
Time constraints on destination groups can be used to make these groups ignored within or outside a given time space.
</p>

<p>
You can set for each destination group a redirect url that will be used when a client request is found in a domain, url or expression list. The redirect Url declares the altenative URL to be used for blocked destination groups.
</p>
<p>SquidGuard can do runtime string substitutions in the redirectors. Therefor the character "%" has special meaning in the redirector URLs: 
</p>
<pre>
	%a	is replaced with IP address of the client.
	%n	is replaced with the domainname of the client or "unknown" if not available.
	%i	is replaced with the user ID (RFC931) or "unknown" if not available.
	%s	is replaced with the matched source group (client group) or "unknown" if no groups were matched.
	%t	is replaced with the matched destination group (filter) or "unknown" if no groups were matched.
	%u	is replaced with the requested URL.
	%p	is replaced with the REQUEST_URI, i.e. the path and the optional query string of %u, but note for convenience without the leading "/".
	%%	is replaced with a single "%".
</pre>
<p>
Thus you can pass usefull information to a more or less intelligent CGI page:
</p>
<pre>
	http://proxy/cgi/squidGuard?clientaddr=%a&clientname=%n&clientident=%i&clientgroup=%s&destinationgroup=%t&url=%u
</pre>   

<p>
The Log to file input box allows you to specify where redirects caused by match of this group should be logged. The value is either a path relative to logdir or an absolute path (i.e. /full/path) to a logfile
</p>
<p>
If the anonymized option is specified the logged info is somewhat anonymized to protect individuals.
