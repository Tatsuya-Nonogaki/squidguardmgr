NAME
    SquidGuard Manager - Web GUI for squidGuard and SquidClamav
    administration

REQUIREMENT
    SquidGuard Manager may run on any Unix like OS with any modern Perl
    installation using the perl CGI module. It must be run on a proxy server
    hosting squidGuard.

    You need to run this CGI script using Apache HTTP server and the httpd
    daemon must run be run as uid and gid holding SquidGuard (most of the
    time this is squid cache effective user/group). This is to allow
    SquidGuard Manager to read and write into the configuration files to
    manage blocklists and acls. If you use SquidClamav, it must also be run
    under the same user.

    SquidGuard Manager use some system commands to manage blocklists and log
    files. Your system must have the following binariesi installed: diff,
    grep, find, rm and tail.

INSTALLATION
    To install SquidGuard Manager you must be root as you need to set
    specials grants on the filesystem.

  Prepare your system
    SquidGuard Manager need to have read/write access onto SquidGuard
    configuration file and the dbhome directory. It also must have read
    access onto the log file. If you use the SquidClamav Manager GUI it also
    need read/write access on the squidclamav.conf file as well as the log
    file.

    For that SquidGuard Manager must be run as the user under which
    squidguard and squidclamav are run. Most of the time this is the Squid
    cache effective user.

            chown -R squid:squid /usr/local/squidGuard
    or
            chown -R squid:squid /etc/squidguard.conf /var/lib/squidguard

    To allow httpd to run squidguardmgr.cgi as a different user or group you
    must edit your httpd.conf file and change the User/Group directive to
    the user and group running Squid.

    To be able to reconfigure squid after configuration change from the web
    GUI SquidGuard Manager use a setuid wrapper as root user. So you system
    may support this feature or will need to do that by hand.

    IMPORTANT: SquidGuard Manager do not support symbolic link into the
    SquidGuard dbhome directory. You need to remove these symbolic links
    from your system and modify your squidguard.conf file to replace them by
    the directories real names.

  Automatic installation
    Execute the install script and answer to the questions as follow:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make && make install

    By default it will install all files into /var/www/squidguardmgr/ and
    give you a configuration sample to include in your httpd.conf. After
    that restart your httpd server and take a look at
    http://my.proxy.dom/squidguardmgr/

    You can fully customize this installation by using the following
    variables:

            CONFFILE => Where is the SquidGuard configuration file
            DBHOME => Where is the SquidGuard DB directory
            LOGDIR => Where is the SquidGuard log directory
            WWWDIR => SquidGuard Manager base directory installation
            CGIDIR => Where to install CGI: WWWDIR/CGIDIR. Default: WWWDIR
            HTMLDIR =>  Where to install css,js and images files: WWWDIR/HTMLDIR. Default: WWWDIR
            LANGDIR => Translation directory to use (en_US or fr_FR). Default: en_US
            BASEURL => Base url where css,js and images files will be found. Default: /squidguardmgr
            SQUIDUSR => User running Squid
            SQUIDGRP => Group running Squid
            SQUIDCLAMAV => Path to squidclamav binary (v5.x only)
            CICAP_SOCKET => c-icap server control socket (v6.x only)
            SQUIDCLAMAVCONF => Path to squidclamav.conf file

    For packaging there's two more configuration variables:

            DESTDIR => Directory prefix wher install will be done
            QUIET => Do not display the post install message

    Example:

            perl Makefile.PL CONFFILE=/usr/local/etc/squidguard.conf \
            DBHOME=/usr/local/squidguard/database \
            LOGDIR=/usr/local/logs/squidguard \
            WWWDIR=/usr/local/apache CGIDIR=cgi-bin/admin HTMLDIR=htdocs/admin \
            LANGDIR=fr_FR BASEURL=/admin/ SQUIDUSR=squid SQUIDGRP=squid \
            SQUIDCLAMAV=/usr/local/bin/squidclamav \
            SQUIDCLAMAVCONF=/etc/squidclamav.conf

            make && make install

    This will install SquidGuard Manager CGI squidguardmgr.cgi,
    squidguardmgr.conf, squid_wrapper and all language files under
    /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/admin/. All SquidGuard Manager css, js and
    images files will be copied under the directory
    /usr/local/apache/htdocs/admin/. Squidguard Manager will expect to find
    the SquidGuard configuration file at /usr/local/etc/squidguard.conf and
    the log and SquidGuard databases respectively at
    /usr/local/logs/squidguard and /usr/local/squidguard/database. All
    installed files will be owned by the squid user and squid group. The
    squid wrapper (use to reconfigure squid after change) will be setuid as
    root user.

  Manual installation
    Copy all files from the cgi-bin repository into the CGI script directory
    of your choice. Check that squidguardmgr.cgi can be executable by your
    Apache server and chown the entire directory to the user and group
    running httpd.

    Copy all files from the htdocs repository into your DocumentRoot
    directory or any other subdirectory and check that they can be read by
    your httpd server.

    Edit the squidguardmgr.conf file into you cgi directory and check that
    all path are conform to your installation.

    If you want to be able to reload Squid redirector from the GUI interface
    after your SquidGuard and/or SquidClamav modification, you must compile
    and install the squid_wrapper with suid root into the squidguardmgr.cgi
    repository:

            cd squid_wrapper/
            cc -o /path/squidguardmgr/cgi/squid_wrapper squid_wrapper.c
            chown root.root /path/squidguardmgr/cgi/squid_wrapper
            chmod +s /path/squidguardmgr/cgi/squid_wrapper

    Before that you must edit squid_wrapper.c and change the path to squid
    binary.
